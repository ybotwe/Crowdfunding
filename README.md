# Crowdfunding

This is a crowdfunding platform powered by the blockchain for transparency and trust. 
The platform uses smart contracts to create and store funds for projects. 
It requires at least 3 of the top 5 contributors to agree to the withdrawal of funds before funds are released to the creator of the project.
This is to provide some form of accountability to project creators.
